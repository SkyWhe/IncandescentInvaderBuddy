# IncandescentInvaderBuddy

The Incandescent Invader Buddy (IIB) is a simple C# application that assists with multiplayer interactions in Darksouls III.

IIB can warn the user when they invade another players world or when the user is invaded by another player.

The user can choose to have the IIB play a thematic audio sound upon multiplayer activity or they can choose to have the IIB email them with a warning.

IIB does its job without linking to the DS3 process in any way. The functionality is achieve by using simple optical character recognition to detect specific messages associated with multiplayer activity.
